First, be sure you've opened a ticket with **IBM COS Support**, as described in [How do I report an issue?](../report-issue/index.html)

* email: support@bluebox.net
* chat: chat.bluebox.net
* web: support.bluebox.net 
* phone: 800-613-4305

If you have a new or existing ticket, and you feel that your situation requires escalation, as in the case of _outage_, you can escalate in three ways:

* To escalate a ticket online, scroll to the bottom of your ticket and select the checkbox beside **Urgent**. Note that Urgent status should apply only to situations in which actual outages are occurring.

* To escalate a ticket by phone, call the Support phone number, listen for the options, and select the number for the **Escalate** option. Currently, **Escalate** is option 1.

* To escalate your ticket using live chat, enter the chat room and let your **IBM COS Support** team member know that you would like to escalate your ticket. It is helpful if you can provide specific reasons or changes in your situation that can explain the need to escalate.

When a ticket is escalated, **IBM COS Support** is notified automatically. If your escalated ticket has not received a response in 15 minutes, we will be notified again.

**Note:** **IBM COS Support** is notified if a normal-priority ticket has not received a response after 1 hour.
