## Box Panel Administrator and User

The IBM Cloud Object Storage Dedicated IBM Managed (COS Dedicated IBM Managed) supports two types of user accounts on Box Panel: Administrator and User.

The Administrator is the primary contact of your organization. Upon setup of your COS Dedicated IBM Managed environment, the Administrator account is created. If you are a secondary contact and do not have access to Box Panel yet, you can ask the Administrator to [create a Box Panel user account](../Box_Panel/index.html#create-user) for you. 

For both Administrator and User, once your account is created, you will receive an email from Blue Box, which contains the following information:

![Confirm Account Email](../../../img/confirm_account.png)

Click the link in the email to confirm your account and set a password. Now you can log in Box Panel with your account:

* URL: [https://boxpanel.bluebox.net](https://boxpanel.bluebox.net)
* Username: your email address
* Password: the password that you set

After logging in, youâ€™ll be directed automatically to the Box Panel Dashboard.

### Administrator and User Roles

The Administrator and Users are granted different access rights in Box Panel.
