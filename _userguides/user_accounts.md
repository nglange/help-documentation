## IBM Cloud Object Storage Administrator and User

The IBM Cloud Object Storage(COS) supports two types of user accounts: Administrator and User.

The Administrator is the primary contact of your organization. Upon setup of your COS environment, the Administrator account is created. If you are a secondary contact and do not have access to your COS environment, you can ask the Administrator to [create a user account]() for you. 

For both Administrator and User, once your account is created, you will receive an email from Blue Box, which contains the following information:

![Confirm Account Email](../../../img/confirm_account.png)

Click the link in the email to confirm your account and set a password. Now you can log in Box Panel with your account:

* URL: [https://boxpanel.bluebox.net](https://boxpanel.bluebox.net)
* Username: your email address
* Password: the password that you set

After logging in, youâ€™ll be directed automatically to the Box Panel Dashboard.

### Administrator and User Roles

The Administrator and Users are granted different access rights in Box Panel. The Administrator has the highest access right, while Users are further divided based on whether they have technical roles.
