## Getting Started with Box Panel

The Box Panel interface gives you a single, consolidated view of your IBM Cloud Object Storage (COS) environment. Its self-service access enables you to  create support tickets, leverage central authentication for logins and user permissions, monitor various functions, and view your invoices, easily. 

This user guide gives you an end-to-end overview, so you can get started using Box Panel to monitor and control your IBM COS environment.

### Logging In 
{: #logging-in}

1. Go to the URL `https://boxpanel.bluebox.net` to be directed to the login page.

3. After logging in, you'll be directed automatically to the Box Panel Dashboard.



### Navigating the Box Panel Dashboard
{: #navigating-the-box-panel-dashboard}

On the Box Panel Dashboard, all users will see a Support Ticket section. In addition, the Administartor and Users with technical roles will also see a consolidated asset view of all the hosts of your IBM COS service in an Infrastructure section. 


On the right, additional details related to your account summary are displayed, including your **Lock Box Messages**, **Verbal Password**, **Bandwidth Quota**, and **Backup Quota**. 

Use the navigation bar at the top of the page to access other Box Panel features.

### Help Documentation
{: #help-documentation}

Click **Docs** from the navigation bar and select **IBM COS** to view the help document for IBM COS.



### Getting Support 
{: #getting-support}

**Note: For immediate support, you can call COS Support at 1-800-613-4305 or email us at support@bluebox.net.**

In most cases, you'll want to open a support ticket to get support. By using a ticket, you'll have a record of the issue and the solutions taken to address your issue, complete with logs of your chat sessions with the customer support team.

**To create a ticket:**
{: #create-ticket} 

1. Open a new ticket from the **Support** page. 

2. In the Modal window, your name should show up as the **Ticket Creator.**

3. Copy additional users in the **CC** field to make them aware of the ticket and track its status. 

4. Add a descriptive subject to the ticket. 

5. Collect and add all useful information to the **Description** section, such as:
   
   * Date and time the issue began 
   * Frequency of the issue (permanent or constant, at a particular time of day, etc.) 
   * Steps you have taken to replicate the issue 
   * Affected server name(s) 
   * Affected data center(s) 
   * Any error messages returned
   * Applicable server logs 
   * Any additional useful information 
   
6. Include attachments, such as log files, right below the **Description** section. 

7. If your deployment is for a new cloud, check the **Deployment** box.

	**Note:** Steps 8 and 9 can be skipped for non-urgent concerns.

 8. If the issue is urgent, you can check the **Open this Ticket as Urgent** box to escalate the ticket. This will prompt an acknowledgement that you consent to pay consulting charges if the issue is non-critical (critical items would include situations in which there are outages). 
 
 9. If you wish to open your ticket as **Urgent** and consent to pay the consulting charges for non-critical items, check the **I Agree** box. 
 
 10. Finally, click the **Create Ticket** box. 

**Using Your Support Ticket**

Anytime after a ticket is created, you can see the text associated with that ticket, by clicking on that support ticket from your Dashboard. The ticket's text might include references to other tickets, as well as chat history and any correspondence related to your selected ticket. The status of your support ticket is highlighted on the orange button in the top left corner. Status indicators include OPEN, PENDING COMPLETION, PARKED, and so forth.


From the panel on the left-hand side of the screen, you can select options to create another new support ticket, subscribe to the ticket you have selected (if you want to follow its status), view your tickets, and view all tickets submitted by shared users on your account. 

To view a list of Subscribers for a selected ticket, click on the **Subscribers** link. 

To have a written conversation with one of our support team experts about the topic of this ticket, you can click the green **Post Reply** button, or you can use the live **Chat** feature by clicking **Chat**. All live chat sessions are recorded and added to the ticket as a transcript.

**Using the Chat Feature to chat with Support**

1. Click the **Chat** tab from your Dashboard. This action automatically directs you to a chat room with support staff. 
2. From here, you are able to view the support staff members join your conversation on the left-hand side of the chat room.
3. Once a support member joins, you can compose and send messages from the chat bar. If you need to enter a new line during your chat, press **Control/Command + Enter**.
4. If you need to escalate your support issue, please call 1-800-613-4305 ext 1.

**Note:** Each customer chat room is private. This means that only the contacts within your customer account and the support staff have access to your transcript. No sensitive data (such as credit card numbers, or private keys) persists.

### Managing Billing 
{: #managing-billing}

At the end of each month, a billing report is sent to the Administratorâ€™s email address. For more information, see [How do I view my bill?](../../commonadmin/view-my-bill/index.html)

For further billing support, please contact the Support Team and we will be happy to assist you.


### Creating New User
{: #create-user}

**Note:** Only Administrator can create new Users. 

To create a User, [submit a ticket](#create-ticket) to request Support staff to add a new User.
